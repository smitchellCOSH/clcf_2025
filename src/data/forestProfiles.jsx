    description: "Prairies were once abundant in Michigan, spanning most of the state. Today, 99% of all prairie land in the state has been destroyed or repurposed, with no historically significant prairie lands remaining. While not a typical forest, choosing the Dry Prairie type will help to restore one of Michigan’s most prominent natural ecosystems, providing habitat for birds and pollinators alike. A dry prairie consists of soils with faster water drainage and generally drier soils.",

This forest type is ideal for previously polluted soil, soils that are highly acidic or alkaline, and soils that are primarily clay or rocky. This forest type may be best for more experienced gardeners.",
